                                            <p>Since we don't charge recurring fees, you may not continuously re-run the questionnaire for existing policies.</p>
                                            <p>Usually, your business policies won't change often so you shouldn't need to edit your policy often either.</p>
                                            <p>If something changed in your business, it's still cheaper to renew your premium policy to accommodate your new requirements rather than keep paying recurring fees every month.</p>
                                            <p>This allows us to keep the pricing affordable and accessible to everyone, especially comparing to the cost of hiring an attorney. We hope it makes sense.</p>
                                            <p>Renew your disclaimer now to be able to re-run the questionnaire.</p>
